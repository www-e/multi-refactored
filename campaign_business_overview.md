# Campaign System Business Overview

## What the Campaign System Should Look Like

The campaign system is essentially a **smart automated calling system** that allows you to reach out to specific groups of customers based on their interests, issues, or characteristics. 

For example:
- If you want to contact customers who have issues with electricity, the system will automatically identify all customers who have previously reported electricity problems
- It will then call these customers using an AI voice that can discuss electricity-related matters specifically
- The system tracks who answered, what they said, and whether they were interested in your services

The interface will be simple - you'll select criteria like "customers with electricity issues", "customers in specific neighborhoods", or "customers who haven't responded to previous calls", and the system will automatically reach out to them.

## Script Customization for AI Conversations

Yes, you can absolutely customize what the AI says to different customer groups directly from your website dashboard. Instead of the AI using a generic script, you can:

- Create specific scripts for different customer segments

This means the AI won't just use its general training - it will follow the specific script you provide for each campaign, making conversations much more relevant and effective.

## Handling Multiple Concurrent Calls

The system can handle 10-50 concurrent calls depending on your configuration:

- **For 10-20 calls simultaneously**: Standard setup works well and is cost-effective
- **For 30-50 calls simultaneously**: Requires upgraded telephony configuration but provides faster campaign completion

The calls are truly concurrent (happening at the same time), which means you can reach 50 customers in the same time it would take to make 1 call sequentially. This dramatically speeds up your outreach efforts.

## Gathering Customer Interest Data

The system automatically captures valuable data during each call:

- **Interest Level**: Whether the customer showed interest, was neutral, or not interested
- **Specific Concerns**: What issues they mentioned during the conversation
- **Desired Follow-up**: Whether they want more information, a callback, or to be left alone
- **Timing**: When they're most likely to engage (time of day, day of week)

This data is immediately available in your dashboard, allowing you to:
- Identify which customer segments are most responsive
- Adjust your campaigns based on real results
- Focus your efforts on customers most likely to convert
