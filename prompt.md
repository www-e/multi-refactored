 yeah i beilve u made some small mistaked , now the approve and decline cards in teh bookings
   page are under each other which makes the table of hte bookings at hte far bottom , lets make
   them all in a windows that opnes up when i press on something on the page to show the pending
   cases , also for some reason the 3 dots of action for the booking table doesnt work now i
   think u have majorly changed something that was working double analise that , the calls page
   as well makes it that when i press on one of teh cards it opnes hte details at the very end of
   the page , what about opening it just uder the card itself , also add index for the calls and
   cahts to know how many we have and so on , same goes for the chat , details open in the end of
   the page lets fix that ,
